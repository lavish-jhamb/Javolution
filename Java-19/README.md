# Java 19 Features

1. **Record Patterns (Preview)**
    - Allows pattern matching inside records → easier data extraction.
    - **Why**: Reduces boilerplate when working with immutable data objects (records).

2. **Pattern Matching for switch (third preview)**: Simplifies the syntax for switch statements and expressions, allowing for more concise and readable code.
```java
 Object obj = "Hello";
switch (obj) {
    case String s -> System.out.println("String: " + s);
    case Integer i -> System.out.println("Integer: " + i);
    default -> System.out.println("Unknown type");
}
```
   - **Note**
      - Pattern matching allows you to match against the type of the object and extract its value in a single step.

3. **Virtual Threads (Preview)**
    - Introduces lightweight threads for better concurrency → easier to write and manage concurrent applications.
    - **Why**: 
      - Traditional threads are heavy (limited by OS).
      - Virtual threads map many Java threads → few OS threads.
      - Great for server apps (thousands of requests).

4. **Structured Concurrency (Incubator)**
    - Simplifies multithreaded programming by treating multiple tasks as a single unit of work.
    - Simplifies managing multiple concurrent tasks → treat them as a single unit.
    - **Why**: 
      - Makes it easier to manage lifecycles of multiple threads.
      - Helps avoid resource leaks and improves error handling.
      - Without it, handling multiple tasks (threads, futures) is messy.

5. **Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator)**
    - Provides a way to call native code and manage memory outside the Java heap.
    - **Why**: 
      - Allows Java programs to interact with native libraries (C/C++).
      - Enables better performance for certain applications (e.g., graphics, system calls).

6. **Vector API (fourth Incubator)**
    - Introduces a new API for vector computations → better performance for numerical applications.
    - **Why**: 
      - Allows developers to write code that can take advantage of hardware vector instructions.
      - Useful for high-performance computing tasks.

7. **Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators**
    - Provides new interfaces and implementations for pseudo-random number generation.
    - **Why**: 
      - Offers more flexibility and better performance for random number generation.
      - Useful in simulations, games, and cryptography.
