# Java 20 Features

1. **Pattern Matching for switch (Fourth preview)**: Simplifies the syntax for switch statements and expressions, allowing for more concise and readable code.
```java
 Object obj = "Hello";
switch (obj) {
    case String s -> System.out.println("String: " + s);
    case Integer i -> System.out.println("Integer: " + i);
    default -> System.out.println("Unknown type");
}
```
   - **Note**
     - Pattern matching allows you to match against the type of the object and extract its value in a single step.

2. **Record Patterns (Second Preview)**
    - Allows pattern matching inside records → easier data extraction.
    - **Why**: Reduces boilerplate when working with immutable data objects (records).

3. **Virtual Threads (Preview)**
    - Introduces lightweight threads for better concurrency → easier to write and manage concurrent applications.
    - **Why**:
        - Traditional threads are heavy (limited by OS).
        - Virtual threads map many Java threads → few OS threads.
        - Great for server apps (thousands of requests).

4. **Scoped Values (Incubator)**
    - Introduces scoped values for better data sharing between threads.
    - **Why**:
        - Scoped values allow data to be shared within a specific scope, improving safety and performance.
        - Helps avoid issues with shared mutable state in concurrent programming.
        - Unlike ThreadLocal, values are immutable and safe in virtual threads.

5. **Structured Concurrency (Second Incubator)**
    - Simplifies multithreaded programming by treating multiple tasks as a single unit of work.
    - Simplifies managing multiple concurrent tasks → treat them as a single unit.
    - **Why**:
        - Makes it easier to manage lifecycles of multiple threads.
        - Helps avoid resource leaks and improves error handling.
        - Without it, handling multiple tasks (threads, futures) is messy.

6. **Foreign Function and Memory API (Third Incubator)**
    - Provides a way to call native code and manage memory outside the Java heap.
    - **Why**:
        - Allows Java programs to interact with native libraries and memory more safely and efficiently.
        - Avoids the complexity and risks of JNI (Java Native Interface).

7. **Vector API (Sixth Incubator)**
    - Introduces a new API for vector computations → better performance for numerical applications.
    - **Why**:
        - Provides a way to perform vector operations (like SIMD) in Java.
        - Improves performance for applications that require heavy numerical computations.
