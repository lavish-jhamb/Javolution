# Java 12 Features

1. **Switch Expressions (Preview)**:
   - Switch expressions allow you to use the `switch` statement as an expression, returning a value. This feature simplifies the code and reduces boilerplate.

2. **Compact Number Formatting**:
   - New `CompactNumberFormat` class provides a way to format numbers in a more compact form, useful for displaying large numbers in a more readable format.
   - New formatting styles for numbers in a compact, human-friendly way (e.g., "1K" for 1000).
   - Benefit: Great for dashboards, reports, and UI components.

3. **New Methods() in colletors class - Collectors.teeing()**:
    - Java 12 introduced a new method in the Collectors class called teeing(). It allows you to perform two different downstream collectors in a single pass and combines their results.

4. **File Mismatch Detection**:
    - New `Files.mismatch()` method to detect the first mismatch between two files.
    - Usage: `Files.mismatch(Path path1, Path path2)` returns the position of the first mismatch or -1 if files are identical.
    - Benefit: Useful for comparing files efficiently without loading them entirely into memory.

5. **Shenandoah GC (Experimental) - JEP 189**: 
    - A low-pause-time garbage collector designed to reduce pause times by performing concurrent compaction.
    - Usage: To enable Shenandoah GC: java -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseShenandoahGC MyApp
    - Benefit: Ideal for latency-sensitive applications.

6. **Microbenchmark Suite – JEP 230**:
    - A built-in suite of microbenchmarks in the JDK source using [JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness)].
    - Usage: Benchmark code added inside the JDK itself for performance regression testing.
    - Developers can refer to it for writing their own performance tests.

7. **Default CDS Archives – JEP 341**:
    - App Class-Data Sharing (CDS) archives are now generated by default to speed up JVM startup.
    - Benefit: Reduces startup time and memory footprint without user action.

8. **Abortable Mixed Collections for G1 – JEP 344**:
    - Enhances the G1 Garbage Collector to abort long mixed collections to avoid exceeding pause time goals. 
    - Benefit: More predictable pause times for large heaps.
