# Java 23 Features

1. **Primitive Types in Patterns (Preview):**
   - Java 23 introduces support for primitive types in pattern matching, allowing developers to use patterns with primitive data types like `int`, `char`, etc.
   - This enhances the expressiveness of pattern matching in switch statements and instanceof checks.
   - Usage: You can use primitive types directly in pattern matching constructs.
   - Benefit: Simplifies code and improves readability when working with primitive types in pattern matching scenarios

2. **Class File API (Second Preview):**
   - The Class File API provides a way to read, write, and manipulate Java class files programmatically.
   - This API is useful for tools that need to analyze or modify bytecode, such as code analyzers, profilers, and IDEs.
   - Usage: The API is available in the `jdk.classfile` module. You can use it to create, read, and modify class files.
   - Benefit: Enables advanced tooling and analysis capabilities for Java developers.

3. **MarkDown Documentation (Final):**
   - Java 23 introduces support for generating documentation in Markdown format.
   - This feature allows developers to create more readable and user-friendly documentation for their code.
   - Usage: You can use the `javadoc` tool with the `-doclet` option to generate Markdown documentation.
   - Benefit: Improves the accessibility and usability of code documentation.

4. **Vector API (8th Incubator):**
   - The Vector API continues to evolve, providing a way to perform vector computations in a platform-agnostic manner.
   - This API allows developers to take advantage of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions on modern processors for high-performance computing.
   - Usage: The API is available in the `jdk.incubator.vector` module. You can use it to create and manipulate vectors of various data types.
   - Benefit: Enables high-performance numerical computing by leveraging hardware acceleration for vector operations.

5. **Stream Gatherers (Second Preview):**
   - This feature enhances the stream API by providing more efficient ways to gather elements from streams.
   - It allows for better performance when processing large datasets in parallel.
   - Usage: The API is available in the `java.util.stream` package. You can use it to create gatherers that can collect elements from streams in parallel.
   - Benefit: Improves performance when processing large datasets by enabling more efficient data collection.

6. **ZGC: Generational Mode (Final):**
   - The Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) introduces a generational mode, which improves the performance of garbage collection by separating objects into different generations based on their lifespan.
   - This mode helps reduce pause times and improve overall application responsiveness.
   - Usage: You can enable generational mode in ZGC using the `-XX:+UseZGC` and `-XX:+ZGenerational` JVM options.
   - Benefit: Enhances application performance by optimizing garbage collection for different object lifespans.

7. **Module Import Declarations (Preview):**
   - This feature introduces a new way to declare module imports in Java, allowing for more flexible and expressive module dependencies.
   - It enables developers to specify module imports with additional attributes, such as versioning and optionality.
   - Usage: You can use the `import` `import module java.base;` statement in module declarations to specify module dependencies with additional attributes.
   - Benefit: Improves the modularity and maintainability of Java applications by providing more control over module dependencies.

8. **Unnamed Classes (Third Preview):**
   - This feature allows developers to define classes without explicitly naming them, which can be useful for small, one-off classes.
   - It reduces boilerplate code and improves readability for small, simple classes.
   - Usage: You can define unnamed classes using the `class` keyword without a name, e.g., `void main() { // code to run };`.
   - Benefit: Simplifies code and enhances readability for small, simple classes.

9. **Structured Concurrency (Third Preview):**
   - Structured concurrency introduces a new API for managing multiple concurrent tasks in a structured manner.
   - It simplifies the management of concurrent tasks by providing higher-level abstractions for starting, joining, and canceling groups of tasks.
   - Usage: The API is available in the `java.concurrent` package. You can use it to create and manage groups of tasks that can be started, joined, and canceled together.
   - Benefit: Makes it easier to write and maintain concurrent code by providing a clearer structure for managing tasks.

10. **Scoped Values (Third Preview):**
    - Scoped values provide a way to define values that are scoped to a specific context, allowing for better management of state in concurrent applications.
    - This feature helps avoid issues related to shared mutable state by providing a clear scope for values.
    - Usage: You can define scoped values using the `ScopedValue` class in the `java.lang` package.
    - Benefit: Improves the safety and maintainability of concurrent applications by providing a clearer structure for managing state.

11. **Flexible Constructor Invocation (Second Preview):**
    - This feature allows developers to include statements before the `super()` call in a constructor, providing more flexibility in initialization.
    - It enhances the expressiveness of constructors and allows for more complex initialization logic.
    - Usage: You can now place statements before the `super()` call in a constructor, e.g., initializing fields or performing checks.
    - Benefit: Enhances the expressiveness of constructors and allows for more complex initialization logic.
