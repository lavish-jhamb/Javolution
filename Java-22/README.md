# Java 22 Features

1. **Foreign function & memory API (Finalized):**
   - This API allows Java programs to interoperate with code and data outside of the Java runtime. It provides a way to call native libraries and manage native memory safely and efficiently.
   - Usage: The API is available in the `java.foreign` module. You can use it to allocate native memory, access native data structures, and call native functions.
   - Benefit: Enables high-performance applications that need to interact with native code, such as game engines, scientific computing, and system programming.

2. **Unnamed variables and patterns (Finalized):**
   - This feature allows you to use unnamed variables in patterns, making it easier to work with data structures without needing to declare variables for every component.
   - Usage: You can use `_` as a placeholder for unnamed variables in pattern matching.
   - Benefit: Simplifies code and improves readability when you don't need to use all components of a pattern.

3. **Launch Multi-File Source-Code Programs (Finalized):**
   - This feature allows you to run Java programs that consist of multiple source files without needing to compile them first.
   - Usage: You can use the `java` command to run a program with multiple source files directly, e.g., `java Main.java Utils.java`.
   - Benefit: Simplifies the development process by eliminating the need for a separate compilation step for small projects or scripts.

4. **Region Pinning for G1 (Finalized):**
   - This feature improves the G1 garbage collector by allowing it to pin regions of memory, which can help reduce pause times during garbage collection.
   - Usage: Enabled by default in G1; no special configuration is needed.
   - Benefit: Improves application responsiveness by reducing the impact of garbage collection pauses.

5. **Structured Concurrency (Second Preview):**
   - This feature introduces a new API for structured concurrency, which simplifies the management of multiple concurrent tasks.
   - Usage: The API is available in the `java.concurrent` package. You can use it to create and manage groups of tasks that can be started, joined, and canceled together.
   - Benefit: Makes it easier to write and maintain concurrent code by providing a higher-level abstraction for managing tasks.

6. **Virtual Threads (Second Preview):**
   - Virtual threads are lightweight threads that are managed by the Java runtime rather than the operating system
   - Usage: You can create virtual threads using the `Thread.ofVirtual().start()` method.
   - Benefit: Allows you to create a large number of concurrent threads with minimal overhead, making it easier to build scalable applications.

7. **String Templates (Second Preview):**
   - This feature introduces string templates, which allow you to embed expressions directly within string literals.
   - Usage: You can use the `STR` prefix to create a string template, e.g., `STR"Hello, ${name}!"`.
   - Benefit: Simplifies string construction and improves readability by allowing you to embed expressions directly in strings.

8. **Unnamed Classes (Second Preview):**
   - This feature allows you to define classes without explicitly naming them, which can be useful for small, one-off classes.
   - Usage: You can define unnamed classes using the `class` keyword without a name, e.g., `void main() { // code to run };`.
   - Benefit: Reduces boilerplate code and improves readability for small, simple classes.

9. **Vector API (7th Incubator):**
   - The Vector API provides a way to perform vector computations in a platform-agnostic manner, allowing you to take advantage of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions on modern processors.
   - Usage: The API is available in the `jdk.incubator.vector` module. You can use it to create and manipulate vectors of various data types.
   - Benefit: Enables high-performance numerical computing by leveraging hardware acceleration for vector operations.

10. **Stream Gatherers (Preview):**
    - This feature introduces a new way to gather elements from streams, allowing for more efficient processing of large datasets.
    - Usage: The API is available in the `java.util.stream` package. You can use it to create gatherers that can collect elements from streams in parallel.
    - Benefit: Improves performance when processing large datasets by enabling more efficient data collection.

11. **Statement before super() keyword in constructors (Preview):**
    - This feature allows you to include statements before the `super()` call in a constructor, providing more flexibility in initialization.
    - Usage: You can now place statements before the `super()` call in a constructor, e.g., initializing fields or performing checks.
    - Benefit: Enhances the expressiveness of constructors and allows for more complex initialization logic.
